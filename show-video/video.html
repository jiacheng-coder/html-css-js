        Do not go gentle into that good night Do not go gentle into that good
        night,
      </p>
      <p>
        Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage1, rage against the
        dying of the light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had
        forked2 no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goodmen, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail3 deeds might
        have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late,
        they grieved4 it on its way,
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not go gentle into that good night. Grave men, near death, who see
        with blinding5 sight Blind eyes could blaze6 like meteors7 and be gay,
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless me now with
        your fierce tears, I pray8. Do not go gentle into that good night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.--------Written by Dylan
